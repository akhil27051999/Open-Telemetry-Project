# ðŸ”­  OpenTelemetry Project

## OpenTelemetry Introduction

- In todayâ€™s fast-paced IT industry, practical experience is the key to mastering DevOps. This course is specially curated to provide hands-on experience in real-time DevOps implementation using a highly popular E-Commerce demo project open-sourced by OpenTelemetry. This project is widely recognized as one of the best real-world applications for learning DevOps.
- This project follows a multi-microservice architecture, where each microservice is developed in different programming languages. This will help us understand and tackle real-world challenges that arise when working with diverse tech stacks in a production environment.

## OpenTelemetry Architecture
OpenTelemetry Demo is composed of microservices written in different programming languages that talk to each other over gRPC and HTTP; and a load generator which uses Locust to fake user traffic.

## ðŸ“¦ OpenTelemetry Microservices Overview

| **Service**         | **Language**        | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `accounting`        | .NET                | Processes incoming orders and counts the sum of all orders *(mock)*.                                |
| `ad`                | Java                | Provides text ads based on given context words.                                                     |
| `cart`              | .NET                | Stores items in the userâ€™s shopping cart in Valkey and retrieves it.                                |
| `checkout`          | Go                  | Retrieves user cart, prepares order, and orchestrates payment, shipping, and email notification.     |
| `currency`          | C++                 | Converts money amounts between currencies using real-time data from the European Central Bank. **(Highest QPS)** |
| `email`             | Ruby                | Sends users an order confirmation email *(mock)*.                                                    |
| `fraud-detection`   | Kotlin              | Analyzes incoming orders to detect fraud attempts *(mock)*.                                          |
| `frontend`          | TypeScript          | Serves the website via HTTP. Generates session IDs; no sign-up/login needed.                        |
| `load-generator`    | Python / Locust     | Simulates user shopping flows by continuously sending requests to the frontend.                      |
| `payment`           | JavaScript          | Charges credit card info *(mock)* and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| `product-catalog`   | Go                  | Lists, searches, and retrieves individual products from a JSON file.                                 |
| `quote`             | PHP                 | Calculates shipping cost based on number of items.                                                   |
| `recommendation`    | Python              | Suggests products based on current items in the cart.                                                |
| `shipping`          | Rust                | Estimates shipping costs and ships items to the given address *(mock)*.                             |
| `react-native-app`  | TypeScript          | React Native mobile app providing a UI for the shopping services.                                   |


## ðŸ“š Key Highlights

- **Polyglot Architecture**: Each service is written in a different programming language to simulate real-world environments.
- **Mock Integrations**: Several services are mocked to simulate external behavior (email, payment, fraud, etc.).
- **High Load Simulation**: A load generator is included to stress test and analyze system behavior.
- **Frontend + Mobile**: A web frontend and a mobile React Native application are both provided.
